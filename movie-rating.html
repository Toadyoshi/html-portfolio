<h1>The Best TV Shows According to Nicole</h1>
<h2>My top 3 tv shows of all-time.</h2>

<h3>The 100</h3>
<p>Love the premise and the characters and their relationships. </p>

<h3>Manifest</h3>
<p>Found the plot really well-written and interconnected. Again, love the characters
    and their relationships. Only gripe is the ending really.
</p>

<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>I don't know how George managed to create such an immersive complicated world but he did.
    The characters are brillant. In terms of the world, it feels like an accurate portrayal.
